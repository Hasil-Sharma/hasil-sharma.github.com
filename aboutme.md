I'm Hasil Sharma, a software engineer in his mid-twenties. Contributing to entropy since 1993 and planning to continue doing so for couple of more decades, at the very least.

Love to work on side projects to help enhance my understanding and knowledge. Some of my recent projects include building a big data pipeline for detecting online abuse, using blockchain to enhance democracies and building stackdriver-like-system for Cloud.

<!-- ### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
